## About Me
I have been working as a contemporary artist for about 10 years with modest income, and my hobby of creating personal websites has laid the foundation for my livelihood. As a freelancer, I have intermittently outsourced the creation of static websites based on WordPress for individuals and businesses.

In 2020, I started studying React and my interest grew significantly, leading me to transition to a full-time web developer in 2021. I began by helping those around me and eventually got my first job as a developer at an art exhibition and event planning company. I have created static content-oriented websites such as company introductions and event introductions.

While working, I naturally became interested in dynamic logic and stacks that interact with user data in real-time (e.g., React-query). I am currently enhancing my expertise by practicing and applying these technologies through toy projects. I embrace challenges and actively think through them. Besides development, I am capable of planning projects according to their context and finding diverse collaborators domestically and internationally to realize outcomes.
